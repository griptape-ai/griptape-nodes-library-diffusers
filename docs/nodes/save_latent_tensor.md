# Save Latent Tensor

**Writes a `LatentArtifact` to disk as a torch `.pt` file. Useful for debugging, or building offline test fixtures.**

Category: `ModularDiffusion/IO`

## TL;DR
- Saves the raw latent tensor — not a decoded image. To round-trip back into a workflow, load the `.pt` with `torch.load(...)` and wrap it in a `LatentArtifact` (or use it directly in custom code).
- Output port (`saved_path`) is the resolved absolute path, so you can chain it into logging / metadata nodes.

## Typical workflow position
```text
Generate Media Latents → [Save Latent Tensor]
                       └→ Decode Media Latent → Save Image
```

## Inputs

| Name | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `latent_tensor` | `LatentArtifact` | Yes | The latent to save. |

## Outputs

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `saved_path` | str | Absolute path the tensor was written to. |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file_path` | str | `debug/latent.pt` | Output path. Relative paths resolve from the workspace directory; parent folders are created automatically. |

## Tips & pitfalls

- **Tensor is detached and moved to CPU before saving** — safe to reload on any device.
- **No metadata is stored** beyond the raw tensor. If you need to round-trip the `source_shape` (used for latent unpacking), record it separately.
- **`.pt` files are large.** A 1024×1024 SDXL latent is ~4 MB; an LTX video latent can be hundreds of MB.
